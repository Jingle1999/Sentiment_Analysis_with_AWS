# Sentiment_Analysis_with_AWS

Human communication is a complex process. People tend to interpret language very differently. Everyone expresses their views, feelings, and opinions differently from other people. That makes it difficult to interpret the sentiment of peopleâ€™s opinion expressed in two, or three sentences. However, this is where Natural Language processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) with Amazon Web Services (AWS) come into play. 
The advantages of ML in this case are:
-	Data input from unlimited resources
-	Fast Processing and Realtime-predictions
-	Automation
-	Simplification and easy pattern-detection
The goal of this Sentiment analysis will be to set up a Workflow in AWS that takes the written opinion about a movie within a WebApp, processes it, and outputs the sentiment that was expressed in this opinion (was the movie good or bad?).
